TODO:

* no individual user accounts, one account per office
* documents always originate from records office
* documents must always go through the records office
  when passing from one campus to another
* ask if project can be made opensores/made public
  so I could solicit contrabutions (i.e. on the frontend design)
* Tracking ID format: <campus>-<year>-0000
    ** search if reseting counters to zero is possible and safe
* confirm final route or improve the shit UI
* Notify the office when user has seen the delivery
* popup when asking for final route
* email/sms notifications

* set more than one attachments and notes/annotations
    ** Add model: Note(id, trackingId, officeId, contents)

--------------------------------------------
