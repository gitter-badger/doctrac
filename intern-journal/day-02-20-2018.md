I didn't bother showing up at the office, but that's not going to stop me from doing some work. I mean, it'd be a lot easier if I could show up at the office without people bitching about hygiene and proper attire. Or more generally speaking, it'd be nice if I could just walk straight into my transparent cubicle  and think about work and ignore everything else.

Oh look, someone is greeting me with a nod. Ignore.
Oh look, someone saying things about lunchtime. Ignore.
Oh look, someone's making a fuss why I have a nice office place while the faculty room is cramped with people with higher position than me. Ignore.
Oh look, someone behind the glasspane is watching me code and saying things like how great I am even though they have no idea what I'm doing. Ignore.
Oh look, someone is making a remark about my tardiness and frequent absenses and how I'd be a disgrace to the school reputation if I was interning at a real company. Ignore.

I'd rather have a secret office space inside the bathroom. That would be super comfy. Man, I miss the days when I was a dumb rock that interacted exclusively with floors and walls. Yeah, maybe I'll try being a dumb rock tomorrow.

As for todays "accomplishments", I have more or less completed the updated requirements on the backend. I've rendered about three 2 hours of focused work. I should starting working on a shiny interface soon, lest dragons emerge.
