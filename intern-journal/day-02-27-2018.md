# Midnight
Today was a productive day, but only because my AWOL spree is still strong and ongoing. It was a quasiliteral eat-sleep-code day, and I bang out code like deadline's tomorrow. Actually, tomorrow (or should I say, tohour) is the scheduled meeting where I'm supposed to present my crappy work to the expectant stakeholders. I wonder where did all the days went, I was sure I'd be all set and done a week before the scheduled date.

As for todays work, I lost track of the things I did, but looking at my commit log, it looks like I've implemented flash messages, fix lots of bugs, handle parallel type for office selection and improve design of document details.
