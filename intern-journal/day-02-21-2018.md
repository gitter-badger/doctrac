# Morning
I plan on mostly working on the UI today, and do the attachment feature if time permits me. I'll try using an offline frontend editor (like codepen) called webmaker and see if it makes UI design more bearable. I'll also try learning CSS grid while I'm at it. I'll get started as soon as I finish glacially downloading the webmaker chrome extension.

Scratch that, I ended up writing client API tests instead.

# Afternoon
I tried to work on the UI design, but I just couldn't get it right. By "right", I mean something that looks professionally made. If I can't get the UI done, I may as well fail the whole project since people prefer good-looking, shiny bugridden programs/websites over featureful, but crap-looking ones. There would be a faculty meeting in the office space where I occupy, so dismissed myself early.
