I plan on mostly working on the UI today, and do the attachment feature if time permits me. I'll try using an offline frontend editor (like codepen) called webmaker and see if it makes UI design more bearable. I'll also try learning CSS grid while I'm at it. I'll get started as soon as I finish glacially downloading the webmaker chrome extension.
