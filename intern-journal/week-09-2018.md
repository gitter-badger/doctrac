# Objectives
It's already thursday, but I have only started thinking what my objectives are for the week. I guess being out of touch with civilization have made my timeline become unsynchronized with the universe, where my week starts on wednesdays. Well, my primary objectives hasn't changed, which is to incrementally put the system into production. I could try adopting a better work habit, such as writing tests or refactoring, but unfortunately such things are in in conflict with the primary goal since I'm running on a limited time.

On the other hand, it would certainly serve me well and others if I try to develop intra- and interpersonal skills. I could start by going to work early and greet and properly address everyone. Then I could try shaving my beard. And then I could try editing my previous journal entries to lessen the angst and hate that partly originates from my schizotypal observations that everyone is secretly stabbing me in the back. Or not. I'll just be myself, whoever that is. If being myself renders me unfit for current workplace environment, then I'll just find a greener pasture that has a compatible culture.

But, in conjuction with self learning and improvement, I guess I'll at least try with least possible effort to adapt to environment culture.
