# Midnight
My schedule is a bit messed up, but I suppose all that matters is that some amount of progress is made. Unsurprisingly, I didn't show up at the office again today, nor did I bother telling anyone my homely whereabouts. Considering that I'm not even that productive to excuse my tardiness, I have a feeling I'll get the simulated boot any day now.

As for today's task, I converted the single textbox into two comboxes for campus and office selection. I underestimated the complexity of the task (meaning I didn't give it much thought), and as a consequence I spent the whole afternoon hacking pastamacaronis until it "worked".
