My awol spree was broken when the chairperson summoned me back to reality. I actually have to attend the stakeholder's meeting, but for some reason I had a very, very difficult time getting up from bed. To accomodate for my habitual absence, the meeting was rescheduled the following day. The chairperson suggested that I can do other work besides coding to curb my awols, so I was assigned to do an inventory check for working but unused display monitors piled in a lab room.

It's nice to do something different for a change, except I screwed up and made a computer silently blew up. I didn't do anything strange, I just plugged the computer and that's it. I didn't even touch it. Seconds later, I heared a high-pitch sound gruadually growing louder, then boom! A billowing, cloud of gray smoke puffed out. I quickly unplugged the damn thing, but of course it was a second too late. Reflecting on my momentous stupidity, I realized I was supposed to plug the power cable into an AVR because the switch on the back of the power supply indicated 160V, and the outlet was something like 220V. Or at least, that was my guess. I mean, I have more than 20 years of experience plugging computers and not a single one of them blew up because I didn't use an AVR.
