# Objectives
Generally speaking, my objectives has changed much since I first started, which is to churn out craploads of code until the system is put into deployment. But in more specific terms, my objective for the week would be to make changes to the codebase in conformance to the changed/added requirements. If I have time left, I'll start working on the frontend design.
