I'm only writing this now two days later, but I have no memory of doing anything remarkable on this day, well at least except from programming. As for the the work done, I have finally got the notification update without page reload to work. Conceptually, it wasn't really supposed to be hard todo. I could've have save my self a dependency bloat by just polling the database for changes. But such hacky solutions probably wouldn't scale or be maintainable--I mean probably. Perhaps I just wanted to try to do the things, the laravel wayâ„¢.

Aside from that, I started working on SMS notifications. At this point, I've already finished most, if not all, of the updated changes in the requirements, so I got a lot of leeway implementing the non-critical stuffs. Also, I've started asking for overtime since the work done outside office hours doesn't count, and I risk of not graduating this year if I don't complete my required working hours. Not that it matters. Nothing matters.
