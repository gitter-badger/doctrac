I came in late again today (10:15 am), but it's not like it's going to make any difference anyway if I came in a little earlier. If I do force myself to attend early, I usually end up feeling shit and just pretend to do some productive work instead--for appearances sake, like good corporate slaves do. I'm going to give up working on the UI for the mean time and just add some features or fix bugs instead.
