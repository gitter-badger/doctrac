I attented the stakeholders meetings, where the system in question was reviewed and discussed. There were lots of suggestions and corrections to be made, but changes were small and concrete enough that I should be able to do the majority of them on the weekend. The live, beta testing will be done two weeks from now. I feel like I'm having a diarrhea when trying to design the interface, so I'll just give up on it and outsource it to someone else.

Aside from the meeting, I finished doing an inventory check for the piled display monitors on the lab 4, where I tested and counted the monitors that were still working. Finally, although not directly related to my usual work, I updated the outdated firefox installed on 14.04 ubuntu machines in the cyber room because a patron was unable to watch anime.

At night, I've fixed two easy but critical bugs that I should've have done before the meeting. Other things of note that I did: add random suffix for tracking IDs, remote abort-sending of documents and commit some other stuffs that I did in a hurry before the meeting.
