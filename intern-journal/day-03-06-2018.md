I mostly worked on code related to sending emails. Of course, as usual, I considered what the (most?) optimal solution is. I considered setting up my own mail server, but have the risk of having my mails filtered as spam. I searched for email API services that doesn't require smtp setup and are faily easy to use, but pretty pricey in terms of just sending an email. The lot of them are for marketing purposes too. Really, I could already send emails with an gmail account, so why not do it just that way?

So yeah, I picked the option of just sending emails with a gmail account. It's free and simple to use. There's a limit of 100-500 emails per day, but I could workaround this limitation by batching emails and send them only two times a day. Plus, with a bit of more work, I could use a custom domain with it. It's a winwinÂ²lose situation. Hopefully, I don't get any penalties from spamming my own email account with junk test messages.

Additionally, around 3:30 PM, I was assigned the work of making the pile of unused computers in computer labory room 3 functional again. Of all the computer's I've tested, only about two of them are not functional. The rest are just missing some hardware such as RAM or disk drives, or even just loose RAM installation. I've managed to screw-open, debug, and then screw-close again for about 10-15 units. I did loose track of the time, and accidentally rendered 1.5 hours of overtime.
